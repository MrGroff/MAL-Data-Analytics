# MAL-Data-Analytics
a project where i analyze anime


currently this is the beginning stages where I have collected the data and have programs where I test basic data analytics on local json files

Soon I will write software to load everything into a database and write a backend in something that isnt python and a real UI to interface with the database and other analytics

This data will also be used to make an anime watchlist webapp with a login system on my own server for me and my friends
